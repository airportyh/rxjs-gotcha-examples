# RxJS Gotcha Examples

These are some RxJS gotchas or things about RxJS that may not be obvious.
You can clone or download this code, `npm install`, and then `ng serve` to
try it out. You'd want to update `app.component.html` to switch to the example
you want to test out. The examples are:

* [multiple-subs](src/app/multiple-subs/multiple-subs.component.ts)
* [share-replay-cleanup](src/app/share-replay-cleanup/share-replay-cleanup.component.ts)
* [share-replay-clean-two](src/app/share-replay-clean-two/share-replay-clean-two.component.ts)
* [cold-to-hot](src/app/cold-to-hot/cold-to-hot.component.ts)
* [data-flow-loop](src/app/data-flow-loop/data-flow-loop.component.ts)
* [infinite-loop](src/app/infinite-loop/infinite-loop.component.ts)
* [repeat](src/app/repeat/repeat.component.ts)
